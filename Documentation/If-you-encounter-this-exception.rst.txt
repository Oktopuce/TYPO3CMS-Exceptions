.. tip::

   Coding style of the Exception report (reST)
   
   Just start writing plain text - as you would do on an old-fashioned
   typewriter. Any Unicode character is fine. To markup special words
   follow the rules of **reStructuredText**. For example, if you write::
   
      this is *emphasis*, **strong emphasis** and 
      `a hyperlink to TYPO3. <https://typo3.org/>`__
      
   the result will be
   
      this is *emphasis*, **strong emphasis** and 
      `a hyperlink to TYPO3. <https://typo3.org/>`__
     
   One or more empty lines will end a a paragraph.
   
   Learn about reST:
