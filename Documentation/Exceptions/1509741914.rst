TYPO3 11.5.0 with composer and news dev-master. Included news templates as they were.

The Issue
---------

The following error when displaying the page::

   (1/2) #1509741914 TYPO3Fluid\Fluid\Core\ViewHelper\Exception
   File /typo3conf/ext/news/Resources/Public/Images/dummy-preview-image.png does not exist.
