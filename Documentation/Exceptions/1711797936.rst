TYPO3 13.1.0 - 01.05.2024
=========================

Installation Overview
---------------------

Using the :typoscript:`PAGEVIEW` TypoScript element to display a content element:

..  code-block:: typoscript
    :caption: EXT:my_sitepackage/Configuration/Sets/MySet/setup.typoscript

    page = PAGE
    page {
        10 = PAGEVIEW
        10 {
            paths {
                100 = EXT:site_package/Resources/Private/Templates/
            }
            // ...
        }
    }

There is a file called :file:`EXT:site_package/Resources/Private/Templates/pages/default.html`.

The Issue
---------

..  code-block:: plaintext
    :caption: The error message

    Could not find template source for "pages/default". Configured 
    templateRootPaths: /var/www/html/vendor/myvendor/site-package/Resources/Private/Templates/

Solution
--------

The template name has to start with an upper case letter.

Rename :file:`EXT:site_package/Resources/Private/Templates/pages/default.html` to
:file:`EXT:site_package/Resources/Private/Templates/pages/Default.html`.
