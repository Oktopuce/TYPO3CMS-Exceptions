   Coding style of the Exception report (reST)
      Just start writing plain text - as you would do on an old-fashioned
      typewriter. Any Unicode character is fine. To markup special words
      follow the rules of **reStructuredText**. For example, if you write:

      .. code-block:: text

         this is *emphasis*, **strong emphasis** and `a hyperlink to TYPO3. <https://typo3.org/>`__

      the result will be: this is *emphasis*, **strong emphasis** and
      `a hyperlink to TYPO3. <https://typo3.org/>`__

      One or more empty lines will end a paragraph.
